# DALI-Based Lighting System with ESP32

## 🔧 Project Overview
This project implements a DALI-2 lighting control system using an ESP32 and a DALI2 Click module. It serves as an educational platform to demonstrate intelligent lighting control, addressability, and protocol communication in real time.

## ⚙️ Hardware Setup
- ESP32-based custom PCB as DALI Master
- DALI2 Click board interface
- DALI-compliant power supply
- 2x DALI motion sensors
- 2x DALI LED drivers with lamps

## 💻 Software Features
- MATLAB App for controlling the system via HTTP
- Scenario-based testing of addressability, group commands, and dimming

## 🎯 Purpose
The system is used in educational environments to teach DALI protocols, IoT control systems, and embedded integration.

You just upload the images, write the description, and **set the repo to public**, but exclude the actual code or schematics. That way, recruiters or peers see your work, but you maintain control over the intellectual property.
